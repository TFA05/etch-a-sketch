# etch-a-sketch
This was a website done following the odin project

It is a website that has a grid
of a user defined amount of squares which are able to be drawn on.
The whole idea is to make the grid structure in js and then when 
hovering over the squares to
change their background-color atribute to the wanted color.

This project helped me learn manipulating
the DOM with js, adding and using event listeners and was the first time I made a website with js.
